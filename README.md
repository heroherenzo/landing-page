The Odin Project landing page project

Making my own website from scratch :D

Well, making this was fun. Learned a lot about flexbox and the weird units of measurements. I tried to follow the template given by the course but I thought it would be better for me to learn how to spice things up instead of following everything pixel by pixel. So yeah, I really enjoyed styling and I might take profession on designing websites. But then again, I still need more practice.

Sorry for the terrible puns too.
